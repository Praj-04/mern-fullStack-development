<p>Bonpastry is owned & operated as a family business by Sergio Stephano. Our pastry chef began baking at a young age in Paris, France and learned the art of baking and preparing tantalizing French pastries. Bonpastry was inspired by experiences exploring the dessert world of Cannes in the French Riviera. Our family's love for pastries motivated her to share her baking expertise with friends and family.We only use <mark>seasonal</mark>  ingredients</p>

    <p>We select only the finest ingredients and partner with the best providers to bring the highest possible quality to your table.  Whether you are looking for a magnificent custom cake for a special occasion or long for a quiet cup of coffee and a macaron, Bonpastry is that slice of Paris youâ€™ve been looking for - berets optional.Pastry is baked food made with a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter or lard) that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word "pastries" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries as a synecdoche.</p>
